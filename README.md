## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (as much as I can remember, honestly)
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Sass/SCSS (which i think was a bit much, but I'm afraid I've gotten used to using it)

### My experience
This is honestly the first project I've had the courage to do in a while. I took an involuntary break from coding due to school, and I'm honestly surprised I remember anything. I've recently spent my time re-learning old concepts 'cause I forgot so much. 

I did start with the HTML because i find that establishing structure first makes things easier in the long run. The CSS took me longer because I forgot so much about Flexbox. I actually had to go back to the books that helped me learn just to try to remember some things.

### Continued development

I want to actually to focus on Flexbox and CSS as whole. I'd like to explore more about it and get to understand it better.

### Useful resources
The Resources I used while building. I learn better by reading so most of the resources I might list over the course of doing Frontend Mentor Projects will be books.

- [Understanding Flexbox by Ohans Emmanuel](https://ohansemmanuel.github.io/uf_download.html)
- [Unraveling Flexbox by Landon Schropp](https://unravelingflexbox.com/)

These books do a really good job at explaining flexbox in a way that's easy to understand and follow. They even come with mini-projects to practice.
